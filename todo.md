# TODO
- Create a repo for the flappy birds project
- make canvas fill the browser window (not fullscreen, but use entire space in window) and make canvas resize automatically when the window resizes
- make the bird align with its velocity-vector
- add support for other canvas sizes (-> make velocities, gravity, etc relative sizes (right now they are in pixels per second))
- use object pooling for obstacles
- use ECMAscript 6 classes for better maintainability
