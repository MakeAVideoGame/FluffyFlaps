# TODO
- make canvas fill the browser window (not fullscreen, but use entire space in window) and make canvas resize automatically when the window resizes
- make the bird align with its velocity-vector
- add support for other canvas sizes (-> make velocities, gravity, etc relative sizes (right now they are in pixels per second))
- use object pooling for obstacles
- use ECMAscript 6 classes for better maintainability
- create background sprites for parallax background
- create some particle sprites for various effects (crash, flapping (feathers?), ...)
- create additional birds
- improve/remake existing sprites
- add gamestate stuff for menu screen, game over screen, ingame screen, etc
